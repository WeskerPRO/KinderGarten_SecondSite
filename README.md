## 🌐 Localization

This project is fully written in **Uzbek** by default. This includes:

- All HTML template text
- Admin panel field names and help texts
- Form labels and error messages
- Model verbose names

**Want to use a different language?** You can easily change it:

- **Templates** — find Uzbek text in `/templates/*.html` and replace with your language
- **Models** — field labels like `'Ismi '` (name) or `'Vazifasi '` (position) are in `main/models.py`
- **Forms** — form labels and error messages are in `main/forms.py`
- **Settings** — to change the default language, update `LANGUAGE_CODE` in `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'  # change from 'uz' to your language code
```

No other configuration is required — just replace the text and you're good to go!
